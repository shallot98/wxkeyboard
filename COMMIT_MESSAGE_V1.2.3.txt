Fix IME consuming gesture by blocking touchesEnded (v1.2.3)

CRITICAL BUG: Version 1.2.2 only blocked touchesMoved, allowing IME to complete

Problem:
- User reported: "上下滑手势依旧不生效，WeChatKeyboardSwitch里面reports有微信输入法的全部内容"
- Translation: "Vertical swipe gesture still doesn't work, reports contain all WeChat IME content"
- Root cause: We blocked touchesMoved but ALWAYS called %orig in touchesEnded
- IME handlers complete their processing in touchesEnded, consuming the gesture

Why blocking touchesMoved wasn't enough:
1. Touch sequence: touchesBegan → touchesMoved (multiple) → touchesEnded
2. We detected vertical swipe and blocked touchesMoved ✓
3. We triggered mode switch ✓
4. BUT touchesEnded always called %orig ✗
5. Original IME handler processed the complete touch sequence and consumed it

Solution:
- Track whether vertical swipe was detected in touchState.verticalSwipeDetected
- In touchesEnded: Check if verticalSwipeDetected, block %orig if true
- In touchesCancelled: Check if verticalSwipeDetected, block %orig if true
- This completely hijacks the touch sequence when we detect a vertical swipe

Changes in all 5 hooked classes:
- WBMainInputView
- WBKeyboardView
- WXKBKeyboardView
- WXKBMainKeyboardView
- WXKBKeyContainerView

Each hook now:
- touchesBegan: Always call %orig (don't know gesture type yet)
- touchesMoved: Block %orig if direction locked or swipe detected
- touchesEnded: Block %orig if swipe was detected
- touchesCancelled: Block %orig if swipe was detected

Benefits:
- Complete control over touch sequence during vertical swipe
- IME handlers can't interfere anymore
- Normal taps still work perfectly (no swipe detected → call %orig)
- Horizontal gestures work normally (direction not locked → call %orig)

Version: 1.2.2 -> 1.2.3
