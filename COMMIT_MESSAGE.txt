Fix vertical swipe gesture blocked by IME content handlers (v1.2.2)

Problem:
- Vertical swipe gestures were detected but not triggering mode switch
- Original touch handlers (IME, key processors) were consuming events after our detection
- User reported that "reports" in keyboard views contain full IME content

Solution:
- Modified WTSProcessTouchMovedForView to return BOOL indicating if original handler should be blocked
- When vertical direction is locked, block original touchesMoved handler by not calling %orig
- This prevents IME and other processors from interfering with gesture completion

Changes:
- Updated WTSProcessTouchMovedForView: void -> BOOL return type
- Returns YES when direction is locked to vertical (blocks original handler)
- Returns NO for horizontal movement or undetermined direction (allows original handler)
- Updated all 5 touchesMoved hooks to conditionally call %orig based on return value

Affected classes:
- WBMainInputView
- WBKeyboardView
- WXKBKeyboardView
- WXKBMainKeyboardView
- WXKBKeyContainerView

Benefits:
- Vertical swipes now work reliably without IME interference
- Normal key taps still work (original handler called)
- Horizontal gestures unaffected
- Better control over touch event processing chain

Version: 1.2.1 -> 1.2.2
